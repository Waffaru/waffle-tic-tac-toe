This program has the following functions:

- It allows you to play against an AI
- It allows you to decide the size of the gameboard
- Once a game is played, if the player wins then it saves the victory to a highscore file. If the player name already exists then it adds that victory to the existing highscore entry.
- The highscore-file arranges itself based on who has the highest winning percentage
- The game allows you to exit out of it (quit)


The grade I am going for this assigment: 4.

I was originally aiming for a solid 5, but making a smart AI proved very hard and would have consumed a huge ammount of time (It is wednesday @8:26 in the morning at the time of writing this README).
So of course, my next goal is a four. I believe that since I've implemented every requirement that there was in our guide (except for the smart AI), using Object-Oriented Techniques, I have satisfactorily
met the requirement for such grade.

The creation of this program was challenging, but going back to my previous tasks and rereading javadocs on methods and classes and researching when I hit a snag did the trick for me.
There was a lot of situations where I felt like the challenge was insurmountable, but eventually managed to solve the puzzle. At least most of it.
