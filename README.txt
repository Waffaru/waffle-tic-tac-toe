This program has the following functions:

- It allows you to play against an AI
- It allows you to decide the size of the gameboard
- Once a game is played, if the player wins then it saves the victory to a highscore file. If the player name already exists then it adds that victory to the existing highscore entry.
- The highscore-file arranges itself based on who has the highest winning percentage
